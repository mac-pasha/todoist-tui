//! Crate-wide typed error hierarchy (T-003, EPIC-01).
//!
//! Pure types only: no IO, no domain logic, no secret material. `thiserror`
//! gives library-style errors with `Display` and `source` chaining; `anyhow`
//! stays at the top of `main` in later tasks. Downstream epics extend the
//! top-level enum (EPIC-02 adds `ApiError`, EPIC-03 adds `StoreError`), so
//! `AppError` is `#[non_exhaustive]`.
//!
//! Display contract for file-touching variants (T-003 acceptance): every
//! variant that identifies an offending file renders that file's path, and
//! no variant ever interpolates a secret value (API token, credentials).

// T-003 ships the error vocabulary ahead of its consumers: T-004/T-005
// (config), T-006 (log) and T-007 (CLI) construct these types. In a binary
// crate `pub` alone does not silence `dead_code`, and main.rs stays a
// placeholder here, so allow it at module scope until those tasks land
// (first consumer: T-004 paths::config_file).
